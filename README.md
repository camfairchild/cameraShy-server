# cameraShy-server
Acts as the server for the [Camera-Shy](https://github.com/eladdekel/camerashy) game

# Project Updates
We plan to continue work on the game, transitioning it to websockets, for real-time client-server updates.
Development is happening when I have free-time to invest in the project.

# Installation
Can be installed by running
```bash
npm install
```
